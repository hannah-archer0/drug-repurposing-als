## Typical Outputs

### From `data_prep.py`
- `ALS_Matched_Drugs.csv`: DrugBank entries matched to ALS-associated targets
- `ALS_Drugs_With_SMILES.csv`: Same as above but with SMILES strings for each drug

### From `encode_fps.py`
- `als_fingerprints.npy`: Morgan fingerprints for ALS drugs
- `non_als_fingerprints.npy`: Fingerprints for 300 random PubChem drugs
- `labels.npy`: Binary labels (1 for ALS, 0 for non-ALS)

### From `train_gan.py` and `evaluate.py`
- `GAN_Generated_Fingerprints.csv`: 2048-bit synthetic fingerprints
- `GAN_NonALS_Similarity.csv`: Tanimoto similarity results
- `visualizations/`: PCA/t-SNE charts saved from the model evaluation step
