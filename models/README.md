# Models

This folder is intended for storing trained model weights for reuse or evaluation.

Due to file size and storage constraints, trained model files are not included in this repository.
You can regenerate them by running:
- `src/train_rf.py` for the Random Forest model
- `src/train_gan.py` for the GAN generator and discriminator
